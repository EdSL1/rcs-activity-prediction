# Human activity prediction
This project is about determining what specific activity a person is doing e.g. sitting, standing, walking, etc. from coordinates that are recorded by a smartphone.

Among the many possibilities, this particular dataset was chosen because it involves understanding the dataset, cleaning data, using machine learning models and analysing the results.
There are popular sports tracking applications that have activity prediction feature and it is interesting to see how it works.

The project was done in Jupyter Notebook using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, itertools and sklearn libraries.

The project includes the following files:
- 'README.md'
- 'LICENCE'
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the activity ID with their activity name.
- 'Train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'Train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'Test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'Test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
- 'Train/subject_id_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- 'Test/subject_id_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- 'Human activity prediction.ipynb': Jupyter Notebook project file
